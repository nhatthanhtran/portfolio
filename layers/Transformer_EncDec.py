# build classes for enc and dec using classes from attention family 
# Need encoder and decoder layers classes. Then build encoder and encoder 
# using these layers, i.e. stack them up. You can define the feedforward here
# or in the attention family code your choice.
# In model.Transformer we will use all of the class define here,
# maybe take a look at it to see how the class in this code use in a higher level.
# Note the transformer example is for timeseries at the moment.
